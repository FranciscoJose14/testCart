Generate a sentiment report indicating the sentiment score and the ratio of positive to negative words.

Example Test Cases
Design test cases to verify the correctness and efficiency of the analyze_feedback() function. Include the following test cases:

1) Test with a list of feedback containing positive and negative sentiments:
Input:
[
    "The service was excellent! Highly recommended.",
    "I had a terrible experience with the product quality.",
    "Good customer support and quick resolution.",
    "Very bad customer support and slow attention.",
    "Poor packaging and delivery service."
]
Expected Output:
Most Frequent Positive Words: ['excellent', 'highly', 'recommended', 'good', 'quick']
Most Frequent Negative Words: ['terrible', 'bad', 'slow', 'poor']
Overall Sentiment Score: 1
Sentiment Report: Positive to Negative Ratio = 1.25:1

2) Test with a list of feedback containing only positive sentiments:
Input:
[
    "This is a good product.",
    "Excellent service!",
    "Satisfied with my purchase."
]
Expected Output:
Most Frequent Positive Words: ['good', 'excellent']
Most Frequent Negative Words: []
Overall Sentiment Score: 3
Sentiment Report: Positive to Negative Ratio = 0.00:1


3) Test with a list of feedback containing only negative sentiments:
Input:
[
    "The service was bad.",
    "Poor customer experience.",
    "Terrible quality product."
]
Expected Output:
Most Frequent Positive Words: []
Most Frequent Negative Words: ['bad', 'poor', 'terrible']
Overall Sentiment Score: -3
